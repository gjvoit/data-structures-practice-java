 * Created by garetvoit on 3/24/17.
 * Commonly associated words: vertices, nodes, edges, connections, connectivity, paths, cycles and direction.
 * Key terms:
 * Order – The number of vertices in a graph
 * Size – The number of edges in a graph
 * G = {V, E} is defined as a set of vertices, V, and a collection of edges (which is not necessarily a set), E.
 * An edge can then be defined as (u, v) where u and v are elements of V.
